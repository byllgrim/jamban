secrete sexy
heftig mye bøtter av cum
store pupper

folk som skjuler en dildo i rumpa si, ute på tbanen

hear the sound
hello me old chum
drink my bucket of cum/rum
I didn't think you would come
Hey there, Ohaddi
I'm just a beach bum
And I lik to drink cum
Chewing bubble gum

They sun is shining and the boys are dancing

hemmelig sex på kontoret!
En mann og sjefen hans!
Sjefen er dame
Må ikke være dame.
JEG er mannen
Jeg er på kontoret 
og jeg synger på bass

Hey, there, boss figure
I like the thickness of your fingers
I don't like the way you look at me
If you look at me and I look at you
Consider yourself a luckey duke
Wont you let me in to your beach side mansion/manor
I'll show you a little bit of beach side expansion
I wanna do a little dance with your BUTTler by the fireplace
I'll take it slowly; it aint no race
I am here to settle a dispute
I might just pee

hey little man do you consider yourself a smuck
dont move to fast or it'll cost you a pretty little buck

å nå skal jeg gå på jobb og jeg skal pule sjefen min i dag
Hallo sjef jeg vil gjerne snakke med deg litt

expansion

for three hundred years
I've thought of your thighs

I can stick my hands
into your badlands
submit to my demands
so far up your ass it comes out of your mouth
and find wild BEASTS

and when nothing and still we jive alive and yet we jive
my power drive
we get a little bit funky
inside your house
its coming straight out of my mouth

baby babooney
I cant get enough
boss man babroney/baloney/jabroney/
I see you think you're tough
boss man baloney
I cant get enough

Can I ever touch your balls
Massage your stuff hahaaa
Scrotum babotum
Get a Jabroney mug for your Uncle James
How about a mug for your Uncle James?
Get a Smuck mug for your Uncle James

Delicious in dungeon

You're a dead man
I have to write
Show you who's right
My behind is to tight
Bring a man to a fight

When youre feeling down go to dthe socircues and see hte local clown
when the clown come tos souyou and ask for a favor
don't let it put it off go for later

Call for preparations
Tell them to take me home
