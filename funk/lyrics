# Part 1 - Hey Boss

Hey there chief
You're looking kinda down
Listen to me mister man
I'm sure you'll come around

And maybe you will
plot your greedy scheme
But what you really need
is my laser beam

Chorus:

Boss man jabroni
Uh! So you think you're tough?

Boss man baloney
It's gonna get rough

Boss man jabroni
I can't get enough

Boss man baloney
You got the stuff


# Part 2 - In Tha House

Wont you let me in
to your beach side mansion
I'll show you a little bit
of beach side expansion

I'll bring some friends
take a chance
and show you a little bit
of my romance

do a lil dance
fancy pants,
fart-induced
hypno trance

Come, on, my, old, chum
Won't, you, have, some, fun
Don't, be, oh!, so, glum
ah! Drink a bucket o' scum

Chorus x2


# Prat 3 - The Reply

Hey now, little man
do you consider me a schmuck?
You said you had some friends
but that's a whole truck

If this is the kinda chums you got,
this party's gonna suck
Good god your band of demons
has completely run amok

OOAAAAAAAH!


# Part 4 - Downs Demons

It's me, open up!
It is time for a follow-up, MEETing!
Ain't you got no... time?
'you afraid I'm gonna make you mine?

All you gotta do is sign the form
Don't you want to... conform?
If you wanna join our reunion
Come on brother, join the union

Chorus x2

Baby babooney
do a little dabba doo
come batter batter babba loo
Suuuiiiiing

secrete sexy
heftig mye bøtter av cum
store pupper
folk som er naken ute, i byen
folk som skjuler en dildo i rumpa si, ute på tbanen
jeg er sexy, jeg vil feste, ohaddi no permit
eh, jeg er gay
nå har vi blitt litt gærne
ohaddi er der fremdeles
la meg imponere deg med gigakuken min

put it down
hear the sound
hello me old chum
drink my bucket of cum/rum
I didn't think you would come
Hey there, Ohaddi
I'm just a beach bum
And I lik to drink cum
Chewing bubble gum

They sun is shining and the boys are dancing

hemmelig sex på kontoret!
En mann og sjefen hans!
Sjefen er dame
Må ikke være dame.
JEG er mannen
Jeg er på kontoret 
og jeg synger på bass

Hey, there, boss figure
I like the thickness of your fingers
I don't like the way you look at me
If you look at me and I look at you
Consider yourself a lucky duke
I am here to settle a dispute
I might just pee

å nå skal jeg gå på jobb og jeg skal pule sjefen min i dag
Hallo sjef jeg vil gjerne snakke med deg litt

expansion

for three hundred years
I've thought of your thighs

I can stick my hands
into your badlands
submit to my demands
so far up your ass it comes out of your mouth
and find wild BEASTS

and when nothing and still we jive alive and yet we jive
my power drive
we get a little bit funky
inside your house
its coming straight out of my mouth

baby babooney
I cant get enough
boss man babroney/baloney/jabroney/
I see you think you're tough
boss man baloney
I cant get enough
you think youre tough
Can I ever touch your balls
Massage your stuff hahaaa
Scrotum babotum
Get a Jabroney mug for your Uncle James
How about a mug for your Uncle James?
Get a Smuck mug for your Uncle James

Delicious in dungeon

You're a dead man
I have to write
Show you who's right
My behind is to tight
Bring a man to a fight

When youre feeling down go to dthe socircues and see hte local clown
when the clown come tos souyou and ask for a favor
don't let it put it off go for later

I hope you are prepared
Otherwise you could be scared
Call for preparations
Tell them to take me home

sit on my bass
and play my face

come on down
if youve got RED skin

No! Synths are gonna sounds the wrong kinda funky.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the look in your eyes
I can see there is no surprise

Embrace in my face
Take your place and feel the bass

Get down on the floor
And gimmie some more
'Til you've given it all
Then keep it going even longer

Hey there little man
do you consider yourself a smuck
Please dont move too fast
or it'll cost you a pretty little buck

Tonight! Damn right
I'm feeling so light
Sublime delight
And the beat is tight

~~And maybe that clown
~~he wants a quick favor
~~Not much longer
~~than a semihemidemisemiquavor

Why don't you go to the circus / listen to me baby
To see the local clown / I'm sure you'll come around

I'm on board with everything
If you wanna try your luck
Please dont move too fast though
or it'll cost you a pretty little buck

I'm hiding in the bathroom,
the door is sealed shut
I'm hiding in the bathtub,
like sexy sitting duck
