I shall rebuild myself as a man in three dimensions

Such a fucking newt
Don't mess with the brute
Shitty pacharute

Look at my long arm
Look at my guitar
Damn my green skin is nice
That greenness don't come at no price

Spun the room
Slap the low
Groom my doom
Bow wow wow

Stretch me out like leather
I am hurricane and you are normal weather
I'm hot and you are maybe maybe not
Baby baby sit on top

Stretch me out in three dimensions
Take it out and forth and go back and then some
Cut my grass like no one is looking
The rock is cooking

Tiny houses don't have room for me
Body wider than eyes can see
He stretches and so big
Bigga bigga bigga big

Science is more than a machine
My skin is green, it's polystyrene
Cars are for nerds, I drive a submarine
I scream to bulk up my self-esteem

Dirty as the words we speak
Yesterday I was meager and weak
Future me is taking a peak
My joints are metal and they creak

gentlemen, behold, my latest invention
with which i'll be reborn in the third dimension
the world as we know it is simply a plane
a billion light years away from the great gods domain
my fantastic creation shall make me devine
and with my new perspective, all shall be mine!

It lives and breathes, my fresh ass treasure
Bigger than your tools can measure

science as we know it is more than a machine
the truths you will find are simply obscene
it lives and it breathes, it has life like you and I
but much unlike me, it never fails to go awry
